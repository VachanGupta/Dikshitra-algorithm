Pathfinding Visualizer 🔍🚀
This project is a visual implementation of pathfinding algorithms—designed and built by me with a bit of inspiration from Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer.

While Clement’s tutorial helped me understand some foundational concepts, this project reflects my own structure, styling choices, and customizations. It was a fun and challenging way to sharpen my React skills and dive deeper into graph algorithms.

📁 Structure
The core visualization logic is located under /src/PathfindingVisualizer and /src/algorithms. The main component is rendered in App.js.

Feel free to fork this repo, remix it, or build on top of it—it's a great base to experiment with algorithm visualizations.

🚀 Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, you can run:

npm install
Installs dependencies.

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to check it out.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

🧠 Tech Stack
React

JavaScript (ES6+)

CSS

Algorithms like Dijkstra’s (and more, if you extend it!)
